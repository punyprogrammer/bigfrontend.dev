### Solution
```javascript
/** * @param {Array<Promise>} promises * @return {Promise} */
/** * @param {Array<Promise>} promises * @return {Promise} */

//✅ Resolves as soon as any one promise fulfills
//It ignores rejected promises until one fulfills.

//The returned promise resolves with the first successful value.

//❌ Rejects only if all promises fail
//If every input promise rejects, Promise.any() rejects with an AggregateError, which contains all rejection reasons.

function any(promises) {  // your code here  
  if (!promises.length)
    throw new AggregateError("No Promise passed");
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let settledCount = 0, errors = [];
    promises.forEach((promise, index) =>
      promise.then(data => resolve(data))
        .catch(err => {
          errors[index] = err;
          if (++settledCount === promises.length)
            reject(new AggregateError('No Promise in Promise.any was resolved', errors))
        }))
  })
}
